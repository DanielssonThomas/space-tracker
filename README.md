## Space Tracker!
This is a small project with the goal of displaying fun up-and-coming space related activities! It is only meant as a fun side project and not for any other use.

Its a Next.js project, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Not currently implemented, however the project will be using [the space devs Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi)
## Getting Started

you can run the development server with `npm run dev`, `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`

then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the project.

## Contribution
Any and all contribution is most welcome! I am fairly new to Next.js and I am sure to make mistakes along the way. If you notice improvements that can be made, and have the time to help this project out, please do! If you are new to contributing to other projects, that works out great. As I myself am trying to learn and get into open source :)
